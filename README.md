V1Search
========

The VersionOne Search (V1Search) is a standalone web application that allows individuals across your organization to search for VersionOne assets across all projects. V1Search is built on top of Lucene.NET, a powerful opensource information retrieval engine. This technology also supports a rich query parser that allows users to create queries that mix terms, logical expressions, and wildcards to narrow their searches.
